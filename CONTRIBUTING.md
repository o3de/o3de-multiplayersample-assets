# Contribution Guidelines

Before you start participating in and contributing to O3DE code such as this Gem, review our [code of conduct](https://o3de.org/docs/contributing/code-of-conduct/) . Contributing guidelines for our projects are hosted in their GitHub repositories, within the root directory in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

https://www.o3de.org/contribute/#contribution-guidelines

Please use a changelog.md or worklog.md file alongside your asset work, especially for impactful changes, or when documenting a change adds meaningful value for others.

## Contributions:

Contributions are more than just welcome. Fork this repo and create a new branch, then submit a pull request:

### General workflow

1. Fork the asset repo: https://github.com/o3de/o3de-multiplayersample-assets
2. Clone your fork `git clone https://github.com/o3de/o3de-multiplayersample-assets-your-fork`
4. Create your feature branch `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
5. Commit your changes `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
6. Push to the branch `git push origin my-new-feature`
7. Create new Pull Request

### Create a new branch in your local workspace

*Switch to the branch you want to use as a base (e.g. create a feature branch off of development):*

`git switch development`

*Pull the branch state:*

`git pull`

*Create a new branch from that state:*

`git switch -c <user/branch_name>`

### Develop on Branch

Make changes (like adding new asset files) and commit these locally

*This will display files that have changes:*

`git status`

*This action will stage your work:*

`git add <filename_or_directory>`

*This action will commit the new work:*

`git commit -s -m "<description of your change>"`

Push changes to the origin. This is required to share your changes, run Automated Reviews, and submit Pull Requests.

*Use the following to push the commits in your current branch to origin. -u will set the branch to track the origin repo. Only required one time:*

`git push -u origin HEAD`

*After using -u, the next time, you can just run a simple push for that branch:*

`git push`

### Submit a Pull Request

You’ll want to submit a Pull Request and get 2 reviewers before you merge your changes to the public repo.

1. Go to: https://github.com/o3de/o3de-multiplayersample-assets 
2. Click *New Pull Request*
3. Click compare and select your branch. 
   1. Base branch: development
   2. Compare: <user/branch_name>
   3. Click *Create pull request*

Note: If you are comparing across forks (if you made one), the workflow will be slightly different.  If you have any trouble, let us know so we can help.

Configuring your PR should look something like:

Add the necessary details to the PR

1. Enter title and description
2. Add reviewers: assign to GitHub users or teams
3. Get reviews and approvals needed
4. Then merge your PR

#### Notes:
* Get a few distinctly different people to review your PR, this repo only requires 2 approvals to merge, but it’s not a bad idea to get others to not only look at the changes but also try the asset changes themselves.
* This repo is not set up with AR, so make sure your changes work before merging to development, or from development to main.
* Test your changes, you don’t need to test them in MultiplayerSample (game)
  * You can use the MPS Asset Test Project folder:
    * C:\path\to\repo\o3de-multiplayersample-assets\Project
  * Or, you can activate these asset gems into your own test project...
